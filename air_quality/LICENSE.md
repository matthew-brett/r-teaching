# License for AAP air quality database

I can't see a license anywhere at the source page for the AAP database:
<https://www.who.int/phe/health_topics/outdoorair/databases/cities/en>.  This
being the World Health Organization, I assume the data is open for
redistribution in original and modified form.  If anyone knows more specific
information, please tell me via matthew.brett@gmail.com, and I'll update here.

* `aap_air_quality_database_2018_v14.xlsx` - original data file from
  <https://www.who.int/phe/health_topics/outdoorair/databases/who-aap-database-may2016.xlsx>.
* `aap_air_quality_database_2018_v14-Notes.pdf` - Notes from first worksheet in
  the file above.
* `process_aap_air_quality.Rmd` - notebook to process original file into more
  easily usable CSV file, below.
* `process_aap_air_quality.pdf` - rendered version of notebook.
* `aap_air_quality_database_2018_v14.csv` - CSV file generated by notebook.
